# Regression_Predict_USED_CARS_PRICE

This Python script analyzes used car data and predicts the prices of used cars using machine learning models. The dataset used contains information about various attributes of used cars, such as the brand, model, year of registration, mileage, power, and price.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Running the Script

You can run the script using Python or in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

### Command Line

Navigate to the project directory and run the script:

python SL_task.ipynb

### Jupyter Notebook

Open the Jupyter Notebook SL_task.ipynb and execute the cells to run the script interactively.

## Analysis Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

1. Data Loading: Loads the used car dataset from a CSV file.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, removes outliers, and preprocesses categorical variables.
3. Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features and prepares the data for modeling.
4. Model Training: Trains machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree) to predict used car prices.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics.
6. Prediction: Generates predictions for new instances using the best-performing model.
